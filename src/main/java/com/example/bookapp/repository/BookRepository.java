/**
 * TODO    Repository
 * The @Repository annotation does not DO a lot currently. It is included in all of our repositories to
 * announce exactly what that object is.
 * <p>
 * By extending the CrudRepository interface we enable this interface with all of the rights, powers, and
 * authority of a CRUD empowered data access object.
 * The CrudRepository has methods for
 * count, delete, deleteAll, existsById, findAll, findAllById, findById, save and saveAll
 * Spring is clever enough to create methods for us, as long as we follow certain patterns.
 * For details read this page
 * https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.query-methods.query-creation
 * We added to this interface findByCategory. Spring will create a method and SELECT statement to do just
 * what you would expect - find Book records that match the desired category.
